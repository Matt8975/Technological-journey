		"You may have noticed this pack contains fluid crafting rework. This mod is beneficial for smaller crafts like melting metals for assline/CAL, polyethylene early on to avoid filling buffers, and soldering alloys. But please donâ€™t get into a habit of using it for everything. For a large amount of chemistry, it is much more TPS-efficient to fully passive and pause the machine via detector cover and machine controller cover. "
